# References
Mathematics Textbook References that I am using in self-studying undergraduate and graduate level mathematics. 

1. Real Analysis - **Principles of Mathematical Analysis**, 3rd Edition by _Walter Rudin_ 
2. Abstract Algebra - **Topics in Algebra**, Student Edition by _I.N. Herstein_
3. Elementary Number theory - **Elementary Number Theory**, 7th Edition by _David M. Burton_
4. Modern Number Theory - **A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory**, Graduate Texts in Mathematics by _Kenneth Ireland_ and _Michael Rosen_
5. Topology - **Topology**, by _James R. Munkres_
6. Commutative Algebra - **Introduction To Commutative Algebra** by _M. F. Atiyah_ and _I. G. MacDonald_

NOTE: I will add more references for more topics only when I finish working through these first.
